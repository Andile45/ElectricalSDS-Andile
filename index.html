    <h2>What OSHA Says About Electrical Wire Safety</h2>

    <div class="d1">
        <p>
            The Occupational Health and Safety Administration is responsible for setting safety guidelines for workers
            handling electrical wires. There are a few specific codes that address the issue, so let's break them down.
        </p>

        <p>
            OSHA's electrical standards are designed to protect employees exposed to dangers such as electric shock,
            electrocution, fires, and explosions.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h3>OSHA Electrical Safety Standard 1910.137(b)(2)</h3>

    <div class="d2">
        <p>
            Code 1910.137(b)(2) refers to the type of personal protective equipment that employees should wear at all
            times.
            Employers are responsible for providing this Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and training all workers on
            how
            to use it properly. Failure to do so can result in steep fines, not to mention injuries and potential deaths
            on
            the job.
        </p>

        <p>As a rule, OSHA requires:</p>
        <ul id="">
            <li>Rubber gloves</li>
            <li>Face shields</li>
            <li>Safety shoes or boots</li>
            <li>Insulating sleeves</li>
            <li>Flame-resistant clothing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Depending on the type of work being done, employees may need additional PPE for extra protection. For
            example,
            if a worker is handling hazardous chemicals, they may need a respirator or breathing apparatus to ensure
            that
            they don't inhale toxic fumes. Regardless of the job, employers still have to provide sufficient PPE for all
            employees.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to PPE, OSHA provides guidelines for insulating protective equipment (IPE). Workers will use
            Insulating Protective Equipment (IPE) to help facilitate their tasks, but IPE is not worn like PPE. Some
            examples of IPE include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Insulating line hoses and hoods</li>
            <li>Insulating barriers</li>
            <li>Live-line tools like shotgun sticks or hot sticks</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Employers must test both PPE and IPE regularly to ensure that they can protect workers sufficiently. If
            items
            are used regularly, OSHA recommends testing gear about once a month. Employers must also provide formal
            examinations in between onsite testing. Gloves should be examined every six months and insulating sleeves
            every
            year.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>OSHA Electrical Safety Standard 1926.431</h3>

    <div class="d3">
        <p>
            This standard relates to equipment upkeep and maintenance. If employers don't inspect, repair, and upgrade
            their
            machinery, that can lead to failure and electrical injury or death. This specific standard refers to the
            construction industry, but the recommendations work well for all job sites. Some elements of standard
            1926.431
            include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Explosion-Proofing</strong> - Employers must maintain equipment so that there is little to no
                risk
                of an explosion due to electrical malfunction.</li>
            <li><strong>Dust Proofing</strong> - Dust can get into machinery and cause various problems, both mechanical
                and
                electrical. Employers must protect all gear from dust-related incidents that could lead to an explosion
                or
                electrical arc.</li>
            <li><strong>General Maintenance and Upkeep</strong> - Employers and employees must monitor equipment and
                machinery to watch out for loose screws, gaskets, and other pieces that may interfere with dust and
                explosion prevention.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Reporting and Repair</strong> - If a worker spots any issues with machinery, they have to report to
            a
            supervisor immediately. Once a report is filed, the employer must stop using the circuit until the problem
            is
            fixed.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>OSHA Electrical Safety Standard 1926.416(a)(3)</h3>

    <div class="d4">
        <p>
            Workers need to know where circuits are at all times and how to shut them off. Typically, the best way to
            avoid
            electrical injuries or fatalities is to stop the flow of power from the source. This outlines various
            requirements for employers, such as labeling circuits with easy-to-spot signage, warning employees before
            they
            start work in an area with a live circuit, and locating and inspecting circuits regularly.
        </p>

        <h2>8 General Safety Tips for Working with Electrical Wires</h2>

        <p>
            Before your employees start working with or around electrical wires, they should be trained in proper safety
            techniques and precautions. Here are some generalized tips that can help prevent a disaster.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make a Plan</strong> - Draft a project plan beforehand to assess hazards, determine proper PPE
                and
                IPE, and locate circuits for shutting off power.</li>

            <li><strong>Wear the Right Clothing and Gear</strong> - Workers should have rubber gloves, insulating
                sleeves,
                and safety glasses on at all times. Fire-resistant clothing can help prevent injury. Avoid wearing metal
                such as watches or jewelry.</li>

            <li><strong>Use the Buddy System</strong> - Workers shouldn't be by themselves. A buddy can call for help or
                perform CPR. Both should be trained in electrical safety and CPR.</li>

            <li><strong>Use the Lock Out Tag Out (LOTO) System</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Step One: Inspect the System</li>
                    <li>Step Two: Shut Down the Circuit</li>
                    <li>Step Three: Isolate the Equipment</li>
                    <li>Step Four: Lock and Tag</li>
                    <li>Step Five: Check for Stored Energy</li>
                    <li>Step Six: Verify Everything</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Avoid Working in Wet Areas</strong> - Water is a conductor. Dry off wet areas or cover them with
                non-conductive material like wood.</li>

            <li><strong>Use a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI)</strong> - GFCIs detect surges and shut off power
                automatically as a failsafe.</li>

            <li><strong>Stay Away from Overhead Power Lines</strong> - Maintain at least 10 feet of distance from
                overhead
                wires.</li>

            <li><strong>Inspect Power Cords and Outlets for Damage</strong> - Replace damaged components immediately.
                Look
                for missing prongs, burns, or exposed wiring.</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>Electrical Safety</h2>

    <div class="d5">
        <p>
            Electricity travels in closed circuits. Shock occurs when the body becomes part of an electric circuit.
            Electric
            shock can cause direct injuries such as electrical burns, arc burns, and thermal contact burns. It can also
            cause indirect injuries when involuntary muscle reactions lead to bruises, fractures, or falls.
        </p>

        <p>Shock occurs when a person in contact with the ground comes in contact with any of the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Both wires of the electric circuit</li>
            <li>One wire of the energized circuit and the ground</li>
            <li>A metallic part that has become energized by contact with an energized wire</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The severity of the shock is affected by three primary factors:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>The amount of current flowing through the body</li>
            <li>The path of the current through the body</li>
            <li>The length of time the body is in the circuit</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Other factors that may affect severity include frequency of the current, heart cycle phase during shock, and
            general health of the person. Effects of a shock can range from a mild tingle to cardiac arrest. While no
            absolute values are known, the severity generally increases with amperage, path, and time exposed.

        <h1>Additional Notes on Electric Shock Hazards</h1>
        <p>
            As this table illustrates, a difference of less than 100 milliamperes exists between a current that is
            barely perceptible and one that can kill. Muscular contraction caused by stimulation may not allow the
            victim to free himself/herself from the circuit, and the increased duration of exposure increases the
            dangers to the shock victim.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, a current of 100 milliamperes for 3 seconds is equivalent to a current of 900 milliamperes
            applied for 0.03 seconds in causing fibrillation. The so-called low voltages can be extremely dangerous
            because, all other factors being equal, the degree of injury is proportional to the length of time the body
            is in the circuit. Simply put, low voltage does not mean low hazard.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the event of an accident involving electricity, if the individual is down or unconscious, or not
            breathing: <strong>CALL 911 immediately</strong>. If an individual must be physically removed from an
            electrical source, it is always best to eliminate the power source first (i.e., switch off the circuit
            breaker). However, if time or circumstance do not allow this option, be sure to use a nonconductive item
            such as a dry board. Failure to think and react properly could make you an additional victim. If the
            individual is not breathing and you have been trained in CPR, have someone call 911 and begin CPR
            <strong>IMMEDIATELY</strong>!
