        <h2>OSHA Electrical Safety Standard 1926.431</h2>

        <p>
            This standard relates to equipment upkeep and maintenance. If employers don't inspect, repair, and upgrade
            their machinery, that can lead to failure and electrical injury or death. This specific standard refers to
            the construction industry, but the recommendations work well for all job sites.

            <h3 class="h3">Explosion-Proofing</h3>

            <p>Employers must maintain equipment so that there is little to no risk of an explosion due to electrical
                malfunction</p>

        <div id="dust-proofing">
            <h3 class="h3">Dust Proofing</h3>
            <p>Dust can get into machinery and cause various problems, both mechanical and electrical. Employers must
                protect all gear from dust-related incidents that could lead to an explosion or electrical arc</p>

        <div id="maintanance">
            <h3 class="h3">General Maintenance and Upkeep</h3>

            <p>
                Employers and employees must monitor equipment and machinery to watch out for loose screws, gaskets, and
                other pieces that may interfere with dust and explosion prevention.

        <div id="Reporting">
            <h3 class="h3">Reporting and Repair</h3>
            <p>If a worker spots any issues with machinery, they have to report to a supervisor immediately. Once a
                report is filed, the employer must stop using the circuit until the problem is fixed.</p>
